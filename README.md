# Complexity Analyzer

__Introduction__

This is the repository which contains my work during my 12 weeks internship at the [G-Scop](http://www.g-scop.grenoble-inp.fr/) laboratory

The purpose of this internship was to be able to claim the complexity of algorithms submitted on [Caseine](http://caseine.org/) by students

The project is divided into two part :
* In the first part, we use the multi-class linear regression with the CPU execution time. The tests are realized on multiple algorithms where their complexity is well known (package sample) 
* In the second part, __TODO__
