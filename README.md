# Complexity Analyzer

> Benjamin BESNIER - RICM4 - Polytech Grenoble


## Introduction

This is the repository which contains my work during my 12 weeks internship at the [G-Scop](http://www.g-scop.grenoble-inp.fr/) laboratory

The purpose of this internship was to be able to claim the complexity of algorithms submitted on [Caseine](http://caseine.org/) by students

The project is divided into two part :
* In the first part, we use the multi-class linear regression with the CPU execution time. The tests are realized on multiple algorithms where their complexity is well known (package sample) 
* In the second part, __TODO__


## First Step

The first step is made of 5 packages (for now) :  
* __gui__ : Correspond to the graphic interface used to check the linear regression obtained
* __kernel__ : Contains the kernel of the program, contains the class used to get the linear regression 
* __main__ : Contains the main method
* __samples__ : Contains all the algorithms we want to know the complexity
* __utils__ : Contains seetings variable used in the project
